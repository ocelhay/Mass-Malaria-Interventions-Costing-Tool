Mass drug administration (MDA) is receiving increasing attention as a potential component in the toolkit for malaria elimination. In the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS), progresses to eliminate *P. falciparum* malaria must be accelerated to address the global health emergency of anti-malarial drug resistance. 

There are several options for the implementation of MDA, including targeted approaches, each of which has different economic implications. A key piece of information missing so far has been a realistic estimate of the programmatic cost of MDA for various targeting strategies. 

The aims of developing an interactive mass malaria intervention costing tool are to help funders and program managers to understand the implementation costs of MDA and to predict the full costs of implementing malaria elimination program. The tool was based on the unit costs estimated from three pilot targeted malaria treatment projects implemented in Myanmar. 

The users can estimate the costs of malaria programs for their intended setting, or scale up the costs of an existing MDA program, by moving the slider bars in the application. In this costing tool, the users can estimate the existing malaria interventions such as community health workers programme and distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed-nets. The user can predict the cost of malaria elimination using malaria mass interventions. If the pre-assigned resources are not enough to predict the budget, this tool provides a component that the users are allowed to add the resources as an extra/optional. The costs of the extra/optional resources are included in the total estimated cost. Summary of the total costs is displayed in a costing table and a bar graph by activity or resources used in a program.
